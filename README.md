## 📸 Dynamic Image Loading

To dynamically load all images from the `src/assets/images` folder without importing them one by one, the project uses **Vite's `import.meta.glob`**:

```jsx
const images = import.meta.glob('./assets/images/*.{png,jpg,jpeg,svg}', { eager: true });
const imageList = Object.values(images).map(mod => mod.default);
```

This makes it easy to manage and display large sets of images, such as for the gallery.
